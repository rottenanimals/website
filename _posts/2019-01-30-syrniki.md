    1. Mix together the cottage cheese, eggs & flour.
    2. The dough is going to be really gooey at this point- don't panic, you don't need more flour! You need faith!
    3. Set your favorite pancake pan heating over medium-low & add a generous amount of butter-- once it's hot start forming syrniki.
    4. Dredge a spoonful of dough in flour (see above for advice)
    5. Fry 'em up. Once the butter is hot (it'll form small foamy bubbles and sizzle, wait for it) add as many syrniks will fit in the pan.
    6. Fry for about 5 minutes on a side-- just watch for when the pan-side is golden brown. Watch the heat so the butter doesn't burn.

Syrniki are one of the great Russian pancakes. They're gooey melty cottage cheese pancakes fried in butter- there's not a lot not to like. You can also boil them instead of frying them, in which case they're vareniki.
