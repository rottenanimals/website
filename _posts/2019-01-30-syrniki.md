    * 1/2 cup flour + more for dredging

    * jam ‚ù§
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Mix together the cottage cheese, eggs & flour.
    2. The dough is going to be really gooey at this point- don't panic, you don't need more flour! You need faith!
    3. Set your favorite pancake pan heating over medium-low & add a generous amount of butter-- once it's hot start forming syrniki.
    4. Dredge a spoonful of dough in flour.<br/><br/>
    **Hot tip:** sprinkle a lot of flour on the counter. Drop in a spoonful of dough. Push flour up around the edges of the dough glob, and sprinkle on top-- then pick it up and shake excess flour off.
    5. Fry 'em up. Once the butter is hot (it'll form small foamy bubbles and sizzle, wait for it) add as many syrniks will fit in the pan.
    6. Fry for about 5 minutes on a side-- just watch for when the pan-side is golden brown. Watch the heat so the butter doesn't burn.
    <br/><br/>**Serving suggestion:** Especially good with some sweet fruit or jam or berries, and some dairy like whipped or sour or fraise cream. rotten animals love whipped cream.

Rotten animals love syrniki.

There once was a miserable snake<br/>
who wanted a cottage cheese pancake<br/>
but lacking hands<br/>
ruined his plans<br/>
no pancakes could he shape and then make<br/>

The snake did not give up hope<br/>
and instead pulled out his oscilloscope<br/>
and build robotic arms<br/>
with all of the charms<br/>
so the pancake dough he could grope<br/>

Dredging gooey dough balls in flour<br/>
The snake reveled in his own power<br/>
Then fried them in butter<br/>
And mmmm he did uttered<br/>
As all the syrniki he did devour<br/>

Syrniki. So good, you'd build robotics arms just to make them.
