    1. **Chop your onions** <br/>
    **Hot tip:**
    The best way to chop onions for this soup is into long slices: chop off the root & top, then chop the onion in half vertically- so you chop the root and top in half. At this point they're really easy to peel: peel off any thin, dry onion skin. Now chop each half. Place it on the cutting board, flat side down. Chop from top to root, so you get long slivers intead of rings. Cut em thick please! A half-onion makes maybe 5 - 8 slices.

    2. **Caramelize your onions** <br/>
    Use 2 frying pans and caramelize 1.5 to 2 onions in each. No crowding, no shoving, no complaining. Patience! <br/><br/> Stick each pan over medium heat, add maybe a quarter stick of butter to each. Add the onions and wait until they clarify (10ish minutes) and then turn them down to low.

    3. **Wait.**

    4. **Wait.**<br/>
    Cook them for at least an hour, maybe as long as two. Stir them around and fiddle with the temperature whenever the urge strikes you but don't worry too much.
    <br/><br/>
    When you start noticing a little bits of burnt on onion in the pan, you can deglaze it. Boxed red wine, balsamic vinegar, worchestire sauce & beef stock all work great.

    5. **Wait some more.**

    6. **Soup** <br/>
    I make the actual soup in a slow cooker, but you could just as easily do it in a pot. Add maybe a half bottle of dark beer, like porter, and a fair amount of beef stock. Maybe 8 cups? Mushroom stock is a good vegetarian substitute. You'll just have to adjust and see what feels like a good amount of broth. Then add your onions, and that's it! Let it simmer on low for as long as I'm willing to stand. It tastes a lot better if you start the night before. Patience!

    7. **Salt**<br/>
    Add salt when it's just about ready so that you can taste the broth having taken on the onion flavor before you muck around with it.

    8. **Serving: Gruyere & Toast** <br/>
    Cut some bread into slices on a baking sheet. A forgotten baguette works nicely.
    <br/><br/>
    Slip the oven rack into the top slot, and turn broil on high. Stick the bread in, but don't move! It'll be ready seconds! When it's toasty you can flip the bread over for a second round.
    <br/><br/>
    Meanwhile! Slice some wide pieces of cheese. Gruyere if you're feeling flush, havarti is also nice, and a cheese plane will help cut thick, wide pieces.
    <br/><br/>
    When you're done, ladle out the soup, top with toast and cheese and put the bowls back into the oven, still on broil.
    <br/><br/>
    Is it melty yet? O yes so good. rotten animals love french onion soup.

walt whitman never wrote about onions but if he had

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o onion my onion

Onion! Luminous flask!

I AM PURE ONION-- PURE UNION<br/>
OF OUTSIDE AND IN, SURFACE AND SECRET CORE.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;our fearful trip is done

Look at you, chopping and weeping. Idiot.

so did the earth<br/>
make you,<br/>
onion<br/>
clear as a planet<br/>
and destined<br/>
to shine<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;exhault o shores and ring o bells<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but i with mournful shred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chop the board my onion lies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sliced right through the head<br/>

Taste what you hold in your hands: onion-juice,<br/>
Yellow peels, my stinging shreds. You are the one<br/>
In pieces.
