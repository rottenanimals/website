    1. **Chop your onions** <br/>
    The best way I know to chop onions is to chop off the root & top, then chop the onion in half vertically- so you chop the root and top in half. At this point they're really easy to peel: peel off any thin, dry onion skin. Now you can chop each half. Place it on the cutting board, flat side down. Chop from top to root, so you get long slivers intead of rings. I like to chop my onions thickly: I'll cut a half-onion into maybe 5 - 8 chunks.

    2. **Caramelize your onions** <br/>
    For a batch of french onion soup I'll use 2 frying pans  and caramelize 1.5 to 2 onions in each. It's tempting to  crowd more into one pan- more caramelized onions! - but  when you get too many onions they cook really slowly and  don't caramelize nicely. Patience! <br/><br/> Stick each pan over medium heat, add maybe a quarter stick of butter to each. Add the onions and wait until they clarify (10ish minutes) and then turn them down to low.
    <br/><br/>
    Now you wait.
    <br/><br/>
    I'll usually cook them for at least an hour, maybe as long as two. I'll stir them every 10 minutes or so, and fiddle with the temperature, but I'm not sure you really need to.
    <br/><br/>
    When you start noticing a little bits of burnt on onion in the pan, you can deglaze it. I'll used red wine if I have it - boxed wine is great for cooking- or a little bit of balsamic vinegar followed by beef stock if I don't.

    3. **Soup!** <br/>
    I make the actual soup in a slow cooker, but you could just as easily do it in a pot. Add maybe a half bottle of dark beer, like porter, and a fair amount of beef stock. Maybe 8 cups? Mushroom stock is a good vegetarian substitute. You'll just have to adjust and see what feels like a good amount of broth. Then add your onions, and that's it! I'll let it simmer on low for as long as I'm willing to stand. Again, it tastes a lot better if you start the night before. Patience!
    <br/><br/>
    I'll add salt when it's just about ready so that I can taste the broth having taken on the onion flavor before I muck around with it.

    4. **Serving: Gruyere & Toast** <br/>
    Cut some bread into slices on a baking sheet. A forgotten baguette works nicely.
    <br/><br/>
    Slip the over rack into the top slot, and turn broil on high. Stick the bread in, but don't move! It'll be ready seconds! When it's toasty you can flip the bread over for a second round.
    <br/><br/>
    Meanwhile! Slice some wide pieces of cheese. Gruyere if you're feeling flush, havarti is also nice, and a cheese plane will help cut thick, wide pieces if you have one.
    <br/><br/>
    When you're done, ladle out the soup, top with toast and cheese and put the bowls back into the oven, still on broil. Wait until it's perfectly melty, and enjoy!
